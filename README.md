# GitFind

I would like to present my first project, in ReactJS, which consumes API.

In this project I used 'fetch API' to consume the Github API and make a request. From there, I converted the data into JavaScript using the 'json()' method to be able to manipulate the data throughout the system.

I used user and repository data, with the user being: avatar_url (profile image), name (Profile name), bio (Profile description), login (username). From the repository: name (repository name), html_url (repository link), description (repository description).
